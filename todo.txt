-- PHASE 1 --
*Add user auth
*Add basic styling
    *Website
    *Map
*Add information on the site
*Create flow for validating spots --> do not implement before corrupt behaviour has been seen (the later we filter, the easier it is to add data, hence the more spots will be added). V1=validation DB where I can mark which should be transfered to deployment
*Deploy to get some actual spots on the map

-- PHASE 2 --
*Add upvote ranking --> issue of spam/bad user behaviour
*Add commenting --> issue of content filtering
*Calculate nearest city
*Migrate to an actual DB - maybe firestore?

--- COMPLETED ---
*Add more info to markers --> contributor, desription, how to get there, safety measures, altitude
*Add curated lists of spots found online
*Fix mouse click functionality
