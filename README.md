# 🏊‍♂🗺️ A Map for Cliff Divers 🗺️🏊
<p><i>I am creating a map for cliff divers, where divers can share new spots with each other.</I><p>
<p><b>❓ The issue:</b> When cliff diving it is diffucult to find spots that are safe, making it hard for people to try out the sport.<p>
<p><b>✔️ The Solution:</b> With an interactive map, experienced cliff divers can share tested spots to inspire other divers and help spread the word about the sport.<p>

<i>ℹ️ Primarily made to improve my developing skills within CRUD and Full-Stack in general. However, if I end up creating something I am satisfied with, I will depploy it and share it with the community. So far it is a solo project that I have been thinking of for way too long, but would love to connect and build together with other people if someone should happen to find this repo.</i>

<h2>Status thus far</h2>
<p>The MVP of the site is basically finished but not deployed yet. The below screenshot shows that some cliff diving spots have been sourced and are shown on the map. You can further click the marker and retreive additional information about the spot. When clicking "Add spot" you land on a form that is connected to the DB that the map is fetching from. To make it fully CRUD I still need to add user auth to allow users to modify and delete spots.</p>
