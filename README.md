# 🏊‍♂🗺️ A Map for Cliff Divers 🗺️🏊
<p><i>I am creating a map for cliff divers, where divers can share new spots with each other.</I><p>
<p><b>❓ The issue:</b> When cliff diving it is diffucult to find spots that are safe, making it hard for people to try out the sport.<p>
<p><b>✔️ The Solution:</b> With an interactive map, experienced cliff divers can share tested spots to inspire other divers and help spread the word about the sport.<p>

<i>ℹ️ Primarily made to improve my developing skills within CRUD and Full-Stack in general. However, if I end up creating something I am satisfied with, I will depploy it and share it with the community. So far it is a solo project that I have been thinking of for way too long, but would love to connect and build together with other people if someone should happen to find this repo.</i>
