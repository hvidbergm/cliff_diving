# 💦🏊‍♂️🥽🗺️📌 A Map for Cliff Divers 📌🗺️🥽🏊‍💦♂️
<p><i>I am creating a map for cliff divers, where divers can share new spots with each other.</I><p>
<p><b>The issue:</b> When cliff diving it is diffucult to find spots that are safe, making it hard for people to try out the sport<p>
<p><b>The Solution:</b> With an interactive map, experienced cliff divers can share tested spots to inspire other divers and help spread the word about the sport<p>
